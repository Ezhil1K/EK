After pasting this, **commit the new file**.

### Step 2: Delete the old `output.css` file

Now that you've told Git to ignore this file, you can safely delete the old, broken one.

1.  Go to the file `static/dist/output.css`.
2.  Delete this file.
3.  Commit the deletion.

### Step 3: Update your `base.html` file

This is the final step. You need to edit `templates/base.html` to remove the CDN and link to the CSS file that Vercel will now build for you.

This is the same code I sent before, just confirming it's what you need.

I've provided the two files you need to create/update.

Once you **commit these three changes** (create `.gitignore`, delete `output.css`, update `base.html`), Vercel will trigger a new deployment. This new deployment will:

1.  Read your `package.json` and run your `build` script.
2.  Generate a **new, correct `output.css`** file on Vercel's server (this file will be ignored by GitHub, as it should be).
3.  Serve your updated `base.html`, which now links to the correct file.

This will fix your animation bug.
