# This file is the standard entry point for Vercel deployment (when using the Python runtime).

from app import app
# The 'app' variable is what Vercel needs to run the Flask application.

# You can optionally define a custom handler function if needed, 
# but simply exposing the app object is often sufficient.
# handler = app
