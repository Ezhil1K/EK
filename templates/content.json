    "description": "I am a dedicated Technical Specialist with a decade of experience focused on achieving zero-defect production standards in automotive and heavy machinery sectors. My expertise lies in designing, implementing, and auditing complex cleanliness processes, specifically **rust prevention** using VCI/HIC technologies, and advanced **chemical management** systems (e.g., coolants, cutting oils, pre-treatment). I translate data-driven insights into actionable process improvements that directly reduce costs and prevent warranty claims."
