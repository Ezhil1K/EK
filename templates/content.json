    "about_me": "I am a dedicated Technical Specialist with over a decade of experience in optimizing manufacturing processes, specializing in technical cleanliness standards (VDA 19.1, ISO 16232) and advanced rust prevention strategies. My expertise lies in bridging the gap between material science, chemical engineering, and production line efficiency to eliminate costly failures and improve product longevity in high-precision industries like automotive and aerospace. I use data-driven methods, microscopy, and chemical analysis to solve complex surface contamination and corrosion problems at the root cause.",
